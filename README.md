### 2. Product description

A notorious source of headache for drivers has always been the dreaded check engine light. When it comes on, it leaves you with the anxiety of knowing something might be terribly wrong with your vehicle – Or it could be nothing. The OBD-2GO aims to make this system more transparent so drivers don’t have to worry about what might be wrong with their vehicle. The OBD-2GO will be a system embedded into your vehicle that will actively monitor and warn you of issues with your vehicle in a more detailed manner than a simple check engine light. It will also enable you to monitor and record vehicle parameters while driving, so that you can know what shows signs of failure before the problem becomes much more expensive.
